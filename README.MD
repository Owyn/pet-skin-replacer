# pet-replacer
Customize your pet's appearance

## Info
- I don't recommend using Crab or Chupathingy in battle because they have collision boxes!
- Available presets: none, bunny, cat, cow, chupathingy, crab, dog, goat, hog, pigeon, puppy, sheep, roaster
- Module is client-side only, that means only you can see the difference. Nobody else can see your new pet.

## Usage
### `pet`
- Toggle on/off
- Default is on
### `pet help`
- Outputs a list of available presets
### `pet [preset_name]`
- Set your pet from a preset. (Example: "pet bunny" will make your pet a bunny!)
### `pet [templateId][huntingZoneId]`
- Set your pet from any NPC model. You need to know the templateId and huntingZoneId though.
